The easiest way to learn building DBMS is making a simple webapp using PHP and MySQL which is very easy and straight forward to use.

Firstly, to build a Database management Application in our local computer, we need to create the environment using XAMPP.
XAMPP stands for **X-operating system, Apache, Mysql, Php, Perl**
We are going to need **Apache** and **MySQL** to create a web application.

#### Let's go Step by Step,

## 1. Download XAMPP 

It is a development platform by [Apache Friends.](https://www.apachefriends.org/) 
Let's download XAMPP from [https://www.apachefriends.org/](https://www.apachefriends.org/)

For my windows machine, I'm going to download the **XAMPP for Windows**

## 2. Install XAMPP of Operating System
As I've downloaded for windows, I'm going with the procedure for windows machine.
Firstly, I'm going to launch the installer.

If the installer shows this error, just click **OK**. This is because in windows, an application installed from one user sometimes doesn't get all the permissions to operate perfectly on the system.
